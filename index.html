    Most people don’t know this, but <span class = "chicken">chickens</span> make great pets! Not only do they provide you with eggs, 
    but they also have excellent memories and recognize your family members, even following around the 
    ones they like the best. They can be very affectionate and love sitting in your lap if you have 
    handled them from a young age. Unlike dogs, they don’t wander far either, always tucking themselves 
    into the coop at night to be safe. And the best thing of course is the eggs you get every day, either 
    to sell on the side or use for your family. 
</p>
<p>
    <span class = "chicken">Chickens</span> evolved from dinosaurs and are the closest living thing to a t-rex! If you have ever watched 
    a chicken run it is hilarious and probably resembles how a dinosaur would have run. They are also very 
    smart and can problem solve. They are very much followers though, so if you can get one chicken to do 
    something, they will all follow suite. There is nothing more fun than teaching the chickens to chase 
    you and play tag. One neat thing chickens have is object permanence, where they remember an object is 
    still there even if you hide it, they learn this trait as chicks, whereas humans don’t learn this until 
    6 months old. 
</p>
<p>
    Not all <span class = "chicken">chickens</span> are white and lay white eggs. Some chickens can lay very unique eggs like blue, green, 
    pink or cream. There are some chickens that are pure black, the ayan cemani chicken for example is all 
    black, even its bones! Of course, these more unique chickens are harder to find and more expensive but 
    they can be worth it for your backyard flock!
