        Black Ameraucana chicken, approx. 16 weeks old. Ameraucanas come in various colours and produce blue eggs. 
        They have very soft feathers and unique feet feathers that look like socks.

        Kids love helping with the chickens. It's a good chore to go feed the chickens and collect the eggs. 
        The kids can also set up a little business selling eggs to pay for feed.

        </figure>
        Chickens always mess up their water and kick up dirt, they love digging and it makes a mess! You should hang the 
        water up so they can't make it look as muddy as this does.

        </figure>
        If handled from an early age, chickens love to be held and carried around. This is my 6 year old son who will
        carry the chicken around all day if I let him.

            <figcaption>Chickens love hiding in places</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Chickens love to find new spaces to hide, even somewhere they can get cooked! My chickens were scared
        in their pen from a predator so they chose to hide in our bbq!

        Chickens are curious! They will come in your house just to look around and find some food. I would resist
        letting them in though as their poop is super gross.

            <figcaption>Eating out of your hand!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Chickens will eat anything. The kids love feeding them straight from their hand, their pecks don't hurt.
        They love grains but will also eat bugs or any food they find around.

        </figure>
        My kids love having chickens and are always excited to feed them, get water and
        collect eggs. Its a great way to teach them responsibility as well.
